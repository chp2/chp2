- **Data Visualization**: Tableau, Power BI, Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
- **Databases**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, DynamoDB
- **Automotive/Energy Domain**: Vehicle telemetry analysis, battery performance optimization, user adoption metrics, charging behavior analysis
- **Tools & Technologies**: AWS (SQS, Lambda), Jupyter Notebook, Git, Docker
- **Soft Skills**: Problem-solving, stakeholder communication, business acumen

## Projects

### Electric Vehicle Telemetry Analysis Dashboard
- **Objective**: Analyzed simulated Tesla vehicle telemetry data to identify key performance metrics and optimize user experience.
- **Achievements**:
  - Developed complex SQL queries using `GROUP BY` and `WINDOW` functions in PostgreSQL to calculate metrics like battery efficiency, driving range, and charging frequency.
  - Ensured data integrity by handling missing values and outliers using Pandas.
  - Built an interactive Tableau dashboard visualizing daily driving patterns and battery performance by vehicle model, identifying high-energy consumption segments.
  - Proposed UI improvements for in-car software based on driver behavior analysis, potentially reducing energy waste in specific user cohorts.
- **Technologies Used**: SQL, Python (Pandas, Plotly), Tableau, PostgreSQL

### A/B Testing for Tesla Mobile App Feature
- **Objective**: Evaluated the impact of a simulated Tesla mobile app UI change (e.g., redesigned charging status display) on user engagement through A/B testing.
- **Achievements**:
  - Optimized SQL queries with indexing in MySQL to extract group-level metrics like click-through rates and feature usage.
  - Conducted t-tests and chi-square tests using Python (SciPy) to validate the statistical significance of UI changes (p-value < 0.05).
  - Visualized engagement metrics with Seaborn, effectively communicating statistical significance to non-technical stakeholders.
  - Recommended rollout of the new UI based on a 12% increase in feature engagement, with suggestions for further segment-specific testing.
- **Technologies Used**: SQL, Python (Pandas, SciPy, Seaborn), MySQL

### Predictive Maintenance for Battery Systems
- **Objective**: Predicted potential battery failures in simulated Tesla vehicles and proposed maintenance strategies.
- **Achievements**:
  - Designed SQL queries in PostgreSQL to extract battery health indicators, such as charge cycles and temperature fluctuations.
  - Built a random forest model with Scikit-learn to predict failure likelihood with 87% accuracy, using SHAP to identify key factors (e.g., high-temperature charging).
  - Created an interactive Power BI report visualizing failure risks and vehicle segments, supporting proactive maintenance planning.
  - Proposed targeted maintenance alerts for high-risk vehicles, potentially reducing failure rates by 8%.
- **Technologies Used**: SQL, Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, SHAP, Matplotlib), Power BI, PostgreSQL

## Additional Contributions
- **Portfolio**: Maintained a GitHub repository with detailed READMEs, code, and visualizations for projects, including architecture diagrams and business impact summaries.
- **Learning**: Completed DataCamp’s “Data Analyst with Python” track and LeetCode SQL challenges to enhance analytical and query optimization skills.
- **Domain Knowledge**: Studied Tesla’s innovations and industry trends to align analytical approaches with KPIs like battery efficiency, vehicle adoption, and customer satisfaction.
